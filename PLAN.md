**Spec:**

The goal is to create a Python module that can ingest hurricane damage data from various sources and generate a variety of visualizations. The module will be flexible enough to handle different data structures by allowing the user to specify which data columns to use for plotting. The final output will be a set of graphics, including a pie chart, a bar graph, and a map plot, along with an example of how to use the module.

**Plan:**

I will start by creating a `PLAN.md` file to track our progress. Then, I will develop the core module in a Python file, focusing on data loading and preprocessing. I will implement functions to generate the three types of plots we've discussed. Alongside the module, I will create an example script that demonstrates how to use the module with sample data. I'll make sure to include all necessary libraries and provide clear documentation.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Create the `PLAN.md` document.
- [ ] Develop the basic structure of the Python module.
- [ ] Implement the pie chart generation function.
- [ ] Implement the bar graph generation function.
- [ ] Implement the map plotting function.
- [ ] Create an example script with sample data.
- [ ] Write a summary of the module's functionality.
